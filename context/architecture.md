# Architecture

## Single backend host after domain consolidation

**Id:** c64c71f5-797d-4204-87d0-d459938dc06b  
**Status:** active  
**Evidence:** confirmed  
**Source:** project agent notes (`AGENTS.md`); domain consolidation, May 2025  
**Revisit when:** a second C# application project is introduced, or domain is split out again

The previous `Backend.Domain` and `Backend.Application` projects were fully merged into the `backend/` host project. There is effectively one C# application project plus `Backend.Tests/` and the Vue SPA under `frontend/`.

**Reason:** agents and contributors kept assuming a multi-project layered layout that no longer exists. Feature work (controllers, services, DTOs, entities, validators, Mapster profiles, SignalR hubs, EF) almost always belongs in `backend/`. DI registration for new services goes in `backend/Program.ServiceRegistration.cs` (`ProgramServiceRegistration.RegisterApplicationServices`, `RegisterAuthServices`, `RegisterBackgroundServices`).

**Rejected alternative:** keep or reintroduce separate Domain/Application class libraries. Rejected for this codebase’s current size and ownership model — the split had become dead weight and produced duplicate or stale guidance.

## Social preview URLs are static and pinned to production

**Id:** 3cdc2a17-78bd-4178-888f-4fc00ba3c15a  
**Status:** active  
**Evidence:** confirmed  
**Source:** production host in `ClientEnvResolver` tests (`https://v4.tallyj.com`); UAT host `https://uat.v4.tallyj.com`; `MapFallbackToFile` serves `index.html` for unknown routes  
**Revisit when:** v4 production moves off `v4.tallyj.com`, or UAT and production stop sharing one frontend build

Link previews (LinkedIn, Facebook, Slack, X) read `frontend/index.html`. They do not run the SPA. `/` is that file via static files; deep links are the same file via `MapFallbackToFile`, so the head does not vary by route. `og:url` and `og:image` are absolute `https://v4.tallyj.com` URLs in source. The Azure frontend pipeline rewrites that origin to the UAT host only in the UAT zip.

The rewrite (`frontend/scripts/set-og-origin.mjs`) changes `og:url`, `og:image`, `twitter:url`, and `twitter:image` only when `new URL(content).origin` is exactly `https://v4.tallyj.com`. A second run whose tags are already the target origin leaves the file unchanged.

**Reason:** one Vite build is copied to UAT and production, and a relative image URL is not reliable for those crawlers. Pinning production means an unmodified `frontend/dist` is correct for production. UAT still previews, because the pipeline that actually deploys there substitutes the origin before packaging. Comparing parsed origins keeps a comment, a non-URL meta value, and a lookalike host (one that only begins with the production origin) out of the substitution. A substring check of the raw origin is the CodeQL incomplete-URL-sanitization finding.

**Rejected alternative:** set the tags from Vue after load. Crawlers would publish an empty card.

**Rejected alternative:** bake the UAT origin into source. Production shares would point crawlers at UAT.

**Rejected alternative:** replace every occurrence of the production origin string. That rewrites comments and lookalike hosts, and the presence check is a URL substring test.

### Practical layout (where to look)

- **Data / persistence:** `backend/Context/MainDbContext.cs`, `Entities/`, `Enumerations/`, `Identity/`, `Interfaces/`
- **Auth:** `DTOs/Auth/`, `Services/Auth/`, related controllers and validators
- **Domain features:** `Controllers/`, `DTOs/`, `Services/`, `Validators/`, `Mappings/`, `Hubs/`
