# People records

## AgeGroup is not stored

**Id:** d585fe81-960b-4d0f-8aa9-4613a5d8458a  
**Status:** active  
**Evidence:** confirmed  
**Source:** maintainer decision after review of eligibility vs leftover v2/v3 metadata  
**Revisit when:** someone proposes restoring a demographic age field separate from eligibility

`Person.AgeGroup` (`A`/`Y`) was a v2/v3 column carried into v4. It did not drive voting or candidacy. Youth who can vote but cannot be elected use eligibility reason **V01** (“Youth aged 18/19/20”). Under-18 uses **X05**. The person form had both controls and they were never synced.

The column, person DTOs, form dropdown, and unused turnout-by-age breakdown were removed. Incoming v2 XML / JSON packages may still contain `AgeGroup`; it is ignored so old files keep importing.

**Rejected alternative:** keep the column for turnout reports. The only consumer grouped `HasOnlineBallot` and the UI never showed it.

**Rejected alternative:** derive V01 from Age Group = Youth. Adult youth (18–20) and under-18 are different eligibility rows; a two-value age flag cannot express that.

## Person eligibility is stored as a short code

**Id:** 3e3a9ae9-4412-4ef9-bb10-3e2929d94a57  
**Status:** active  
**Evidence:** confirmed  
**Source:** issue #263  
**Revisit when:** a new reason is added, or an incoming package format no longer carries GUIDs

`Person` stores `IneligibleReasonCode` (`X01`, `V04`, …). Empty/null means fully eligible. Votes already stored the same short code.

GUIDs stay on `IneligibleReasonEnum` only so old JSON packages and v2/v3 XML can still be imported. Incoming files may send a code or a GUID (including legacy v3 sub-reason GUIDs); only the code is persisted. New package export writes the code.

**Rejected alternative:** keep `IneligibleReasonGuid` on Person and derive the code at the API. Create/update, name import, and the person form all used the code already; the GUID column was leftover v3 storage.

**Rejected alternative:** store both columns. Two sources of truth would drift, and the index would still need the GUID.

## Cannot mark cannot-vote after a ballot is accepted

**Id:** 5d447e9c-d56d-4f09-86f3-0ba09933baee  
**Status:** active  
**Evidence:** confirmed  
**Source:** TallyJ-3.0 `Site/Views/Setup/EditPerson.cshtml.js` (`updateReasons(!!VotingMethod)`); v4 write gate in `PeopleService.UpdatePersonAsync` (evidence: v3 `EditPerson.updateReasons`; issue #171)  
**Revisit when:** pending online ballots (not yet accepted) should also lock eligibility, or paper “accepted” should mean a `Ballot` row instead of Front Desk `VotingMethod`

v3 disabled eligibility options with `CanVote === false` once the person had a voting method. The person-form tip said they cannot change to a non-voting option after voting. v4 only had the Finalized write lock (#308) — tellers could still set X/R reasons after check-in or Accept-all.

`HasAcceptedBallot` is Front Desk `VotingMethod` (the paper/mail/call-in record that a ballot was received) or an `OnlineVotingInfo` row with status `Processed` (Accept-all). `Person.HasOnlineBallot` is set on the first online write (Draft autosave or Submitted) and is not the accepted signal. Pending `Submitted` / `Processing` rows do not lock. Draft is also not accepted. V-group reasons (can vote, cannot receive) stay allowed so votes they already received can still be spoiled.

The API throws `people.cannotMarkCannotVoteAfterVoted` before copying fields. Person detail exposes the combined `HasAcceptedBallot` flag and the latest `OnlineBallotStatus` (Draft / Submitted / Processing / Processed) so tellers can see pending vs accepted online on the person form. The person form disables X/R from `HasAcceptedBallot`, not from `hasOnlineBallot`. Finalized still wins first. Front Desk shows the same per-person online status; the monitor stays counts-only.

**Rejected alternative:** UI-only disable, matching v3. Rejected — #171 asked to verify the status cannot be changed; a write gate matches other Front Desk locks.

**Rejected alternative:** treat `Person.HasOnlineBallot` as the online half of “accepted”. Rejected — that flag is set on the first online write (including Draft), not Accept-all. Accepted vs pending is `OnlineVotingInfo.Status` (`Processed` vs `Submitted` / `Processing`). Paper check-in still uses `VotingMethod`.

## Guest tellers add people only when Can Add People is on

**Id:** 72c0df24-e281-4b4b-803e-1b5242c703a8  
**Status:** active  
**Evidence:** confirmed  
**Source:** TallyJ-3.0 `PeopleModel.SavePerson`, `BallotNormal.cshtml.js` `prepareReasons`, Setup “Can Add People?” (evidence: v3 ExtraSetting GA / `Election.GuestTellersCanAddPeople`; issue #186)  
**Revisit when:** a logged-in assistant role is added that is neither guest nor full teller

v3 had no special “Name not in the List” spoil GUID. The ballot spoiled-reason dropdown started with an optgroup **Name not in the List**: either “Add new name (including spoiled)” when `GuestTellersCanAddPeople` was on, or “(Ask head teller to add required name)” when it was off. Adding an eligible person is a valid vote. Known/full tellers could always add. Guests could add only when that election flag was on (default off).

v4 already had `BallotAddPersonPanel` (U01 / U02 / create person). The missing product pieces were the election switch (next to the access code, same as v3), the guest write gate on `PeopleService.CreatePersonAsync` (`people.guestCannotAddPeople`), and the v3 labels on ballot entry.

**Rejected alternative:** a dedicated spoil reason or vote type for “name not in the list”. Rejected — v3 treated it as adding a person, not as a reason GUID.

**Rejected alternative:** let guests add people whenever they can enter ballots. Rejected — v3 defaulted GA to false so a logged-in teller had to add new names.

## Confidential voters are ordinary people named Confidential X

**Id:** e2225935-2bda-4308-b35d-895ac46c7444  
**Status:** active  
**Evidence:** confirmed  
**Source:** v3 convention (Add New Person + Front Desk check-in) (evidence: maintainer product correction on #186 / PR #334; no Confidential feature in v3 code)  
**Revisit when:** a jurisdiction asks for a first-class anonymous-voter type

There is no Confidential person type and no Analyze step for them. Tellers add `Confidential 1`, `Confidential 2`, and so on as normal eligible people and check them in. Calculated Eligible Voters and In Person go up the same as for any other person. Analyze does not mention confidential.

**Rejected alternative:** an Add Confidential button or auto-numbered Confidential N. Rejected — v3 never had that product.

**Rejected alternative:** override Eligible Voters on Analyze so the listed count stays as it was. Rejected — adding the person is supposed to increase the calculated eligible count.
