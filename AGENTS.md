# TallyJ 4 agent notes

This file contains the repo-specific guidance that should stay current for AI agents and human contributors.

## Keep the Why

This project uses [Keep the Why](https://keepthewhy.com) to preserve the reasoning behind the code. The `.keep-the-why` file at the project root is its config; the skill is pinned and vendored at `.agents/skills/keep-the-why/`.

Before doing anything else in a session, whatever the first request is about, load the skill: read `.agents/skills/keep-the-why/SKILL.md` and follow it, including the `references/*.md` files it points to for the situation at hand.

- **Why things are the way they are:** start at `context/index.md`, then open only the topic files relevant to the task.
- Read `context/` before non-trivial changes that touch architecture, auth, realtime, or API contracts — avoid re-litigating or accidentally reverting settled decisions.
- Continuous capture is active. Record non-obvious decisions, rejected alternatives, and workarounds in the matching topic file under `context/`.
- Do not invent rationale; mark Evidence as confirmed / inferred / unknown.

Keep the Why's config for this project migrated to .keep-the-why on 2026-10-05 — requires skill version 0.10.0 or later to read it.

## Canonical docs

Use these as the primary sources of current project guidance:

- `context/index.md` — why the project is built the way it is (Keep the Why)
- `AGENTS_REASONING.md`
- `README.md`
- `backend/README.md`
- `frontend/README.md`
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`
- `E2E_TESTING_GUIDE.md`

Treat `.zenflow/tasks/**` and `.zencoder/**` as historical planning and research artifacts unless a task explicitly tells you to consult them.

## Repository shape

- `backend/` - ASP.NET Core API host (contains the complete application: all controllers, services, DTOs, entities, MainDbContext, identity models, enumerations, validators, mappings, hubs, etc.)
- `Backend.Tests/` - xUnit tests
- `frontend/` - Vue 3 SPA

## Project layering reality (important for AI agents)

All server code lives under `backend/`:

- **Data / Persistence**: `Context/MainDbContext.cs`, `Entities/`, `Enumerations/`, `Identity/AppUser.cs`, `Interfaces/`, `SecurityEnums.cs`
- **Auth layer**: `DTOs/Auth/`, `Services/Auth/` (JwtTokenService, LocalAuthService, TwoFactorService, etc.), plus related controllers and validators
- **Domain functionality** (the vast majority of the system):
  - All controllers under `Controllers/`
  - DTOs under `DTOs/` (Elections, People, Ballots, Results, OnlineVoting, FrontDesk, etc.)
  - ~60+ services under `Services/` (ElectionService, TallyService, BallotService, PeopleService, DashboardService, ReportService, import/export services, analyzers, etc.)
  - All FluentValidation validators (`Validators/`)
  - All Mapster mapping profiles (`Mappings/`)
  - All SignalR hubs (`Hubs/`)
  - Authorization handlers, custom middleware, JSON localization provider, EF migrations and seeder, etc.

**Practical rule of thumb**:
Virtually all C# changes for features (election-scoped or otherwise) happen inside the single `backend/` project. The test project is `Backend.Tests/`. Update DI registration lists in `backend/Program.ServiceRegistration.cs` (`ProgramServiceRegistration.RegisterApplicationServices`, `RegisterAuthServices`, `RegisterBackgroundServices`) when adding new services.

## Core conventions

### Frontend

- Vue SFC order is always:
  1. `<script setup lang="ts">`
  2. `<template>`
  3. `<style lang="less">`
- Do not use scoped `<style>`
- Nest style rules under the component root selector
- Use Pinia stores for state management but avoid putting much logic in the store.
- Use `$t()` for all user-facing strings
- Standard flow: `component -> store -> service -> generated API client -> backend`
- **Viewport-filling `el-table` height:** use `useViewportTableHeight` from `src/composables/useViewportTableHeight.ts` instead of hard-coded `height="600"` when a table should fill remaining main-layout space without page scrollbars. Options, examples, and the Front Desk reference implementation are documented in `frontend/README.md` (Composables section).

### Backend

- Use DTOs for API input/output
- Use **Mapster** (not AutoMapper) for entity-to-DTO mapping. Registration + scan in `backend/Program.cs:181-185` (`AddMapster()` + `TypeAdapterConfig.GlobalSettings.Scan(typeof(Program).Assembly)`). Create profiles in `backend/Mappings/*Profile.cs` that implement `IRegister`. Inject `IMapper` (MapsterMapper namespace) in services. See `backend/Mappings/ElectionProfile.cs:12-42` for a full example with enum helpers and `IgnoreNullValues`.
- Use FluentValidation for request validation
- Keep controller logic thin and use services for business rules
- Default API auth is JWT unless an endpoint is explicitly anonymous

## Important architecture details

### Auth claim lookup

User IDs are stored in JWT `sub` claims. On .NET 10, code that reads the current user ID should check both:

```csharp
User.FindFirst(ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier)?.Value ?? User.FindFirst("sub")?.Value
```

### API response wrappers

Two response patterns are in active use:

1. `ApiResponse<T>` returns payload in `.data`
2. `PaginatedResponse<T>` returns `.items` at the root

Do not assume every backend response uses the same wrapper.

### SignalR group naming and hubs

There are 10 hubs under `backend/Hubs/`. **Do not assume a single `election-{guid}` convention** (the previous short recommendation is not present in code).

Group name patterns (constructed via `GetGroupName` statics in each hub + used for broadcasts in `SignalRNotificationService.cs`):

- `Main{electionGuid}` — MainHub (election updates, statusChanged, electionClosed, tellersChanged). Also creates `Main{ guid }Known` / `Main{ guid }Guest` variants.
- `Analyze{electionGuid}` — AnalyzeHub (tallyProgress / tallyComplete).
- `FrontDesk{electionGuid}` — FrontDeskHub (PersonAdded/Updated/Deleted, PersonCheckedIn, PersonFlagsUpdated, VoterCountUpdated, PersonVoteCountUpdated, updateBallots, reloadPage, updateOnlineElection). See `context/realtime.md`.
- `BallotImport{electionGuid}` — BallotImportHub (importProgress, importError, importComplete; camelCase; via SignalRNotificationService).
- `PeopleImport{electionGuid}` — PeopleImportHub (same event names; progress payload `{ processed, total, status }`).
- `ElectionPackageImport{userId}` — ElectionPackageImportHub (loaderStatus message + isTemporary; known teller; package load on dashboard).
- `Public` (static group) — PublicHub for guest-teller joinable elections list updates.
- `AllVoters` (global) — AllVotersHub (`/hubs/all-voters`): thin `updateVoters` for online window/process; `JoinElection` / `LeaveElection` record an anonymous ballot-page session count for Monitor Progress (connection id only). OnlineVoter JWT.
- `Voter{voterId}` — VoterPersonalHub (`/hubs/voter-personal`): thin `updateVoter` (registration / login-elsewhere); group from JWT only.
- `VoterCode{channelId}` — VoterCodeHub (`/hubs/voter-code`): anonymous pre-auth login-code delivery status (`codeDeliveryStatus`). Join with the server-issued `channelToken` from `requestCode` (not a client key, not the OTP).

**Frontend side**: `src/services/signalrService.ts` provides `connectToMainHub()`, `connectToAnalyzeHub()`, `connectToFrontDeskHub()`, `connectVoterHubs()`, etc. + `joinElection(guid)`, `joinDashboardElections(guids)` (known-teller multi-listen), `joinTallySession(guid)`, etc. Stores (electionStore, ballotStore, peopleStore, onlineVotingStore, etc.) call these and wire `connection.on("eventName", handler)`. Voter hubs authenticate with the httpOnly `voter_token` cookie (`withCredentials`); do not add a client `accessTokenFactory` for voters.

When adding or touching real-time features, update the matching hub + the corresponding method in `SignalRNotificationService.cs` (see examples at lines 55, 73, 92, 111, 135, 152, 170, 189) + the frontend service + any store subscriptions together.

See also `backend/Hubs/MainHub.cs:107`, `AnalyzeHub.cs:119`, `FrontDeskHub.cs:118` and siblings for the `GetGroupName` implementations.

## Validation commands

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run check
npm run test:run
```

## Regenerating the OpenAPI / TypeScript client

Any change to backend DTOs, controllers, or new endpoints requires regenerating the frontend client so that `src/api/gen/configService/` and the services/stores that depend on it stay in sync.

**Steps (clean dev environment)**:

1. Write the live contract in the **Development** environment. From `backend/`:

   ```bash
   dotnet run -- --exit-after-start
   ```

   The `--` is required so `--exit-after-start` is passed to the app, not to `dotnet run`. That flag also skips SQL (`--skip-database` is implied). The app writes `frontend/openApi/tallyj.json` (`app.WriteOpenApiSpecToFile(...)` in `backend/Program.AppPipeline.cs`) and then stops. It does not listen on a port and does not open a database, so **run this even if `dotnet watch` / IDE already has a backend listening**.

   `dotnet watch` hot-reloads many C# edits but fails on a lot of them, and it **never** rewrites the OpenAPI spec — that file is written only on a fresh start. Do not treat a running watch process as having an up-to-date `tallyj.json`.

   On Windows, if `dotnet run` fails with MSB3026 because `Backend.exe` is locked by the watch process, retry with `dotnet run --no-build -- --exit-after-start` (watch already compiled).

2. `cd frontend`

3. `npm run gen` (runs `@hey-api/openapi-ts` using the config at `frontend/openApi/config.backend.ts`).

   The script in `package.json` invokes the CLI with `--file ../openApi/config.backend.ts`. When `npm run gen` (or `npm start`) is executed from inside the `frontend/` directory — the standard local development workflow — this successfully loads the actual config file at `frontend/openApi/config.backend.ts`. The generator resolves relative paths declared inside the config file (for example `input.path: "./openApi/tallyj.json"`) relative to the directory containing that config file, not relative to the current working directory. This is why the documented commands work reliably without modification in normal use.

4. (Recommended after significant changes) `npm run check && npm run test:run`.

5. Inspect the generated output (`src/api/gen/configService/types.gen.ts`, `sdk.gen.ts`) and update any hand-written adapters, date converters, or custom `ElectionDto` / response mappings inside `src/services/*Service.ts` and the corresponding Pinia stores. All calls to
   the backend server should be through the generated API wrappers.

**Verification**:

- The changed or new endpoint appears in the generated SDK (grep the `sdk.gen.ts` file).
- Your feature works end-to-end (Swagger at `/swagger` on the running backend is always the source of truth for the current contract).

**Never** hand-edit anything under `src/api/gen/` — it is fully overwritten on the next successful regen.

See also:

- `frontend/openApi/config.backend.ts` (input spec path + output dir + plugins)
- `frontend/src/services/` (many thin wrappers + manual mapping examples, e.g. `electionService.ts`)
- The "Adding a frontend feature" workflow below once it is added.

## Locales

Run `npm run validate:i18n` when you touch locale files.

When adding new user-facing strings, **only add them to the English locale** (`src/locales/en/`).
Other languages are updated separately in periodic review cycles — do not add placeholder or machine-translated strings to non-English locales.

`npm run validate:i18n` treats `en` as the reference catalog. A key that is in English but missing from another locale — including a file that exists only under `en/` — is a non-failing per-locale count (`fr: 733 keys awaiting translation`). A key that is in a translation but absent from English is stale and fails the check. The frontend Azure pipeline runs this before the build.

Each message leaf is `{ "t": "<text>", "s": "source", "w": "<ISO-8601 UTC>" }`, not a bare string. Bump `w` when the English text changes. Other locales use `s` of `ai`, `human`, or `approved`. The vue-i18n load path and `merge-locales` unwrap to `t`; production `bundled/` files stay text-only. See `docs/i18n-rich-entries-upgrade.md` and `context/i18n-rich-entries.md`.

**Never edit files in `src/locales/bundled/`** — these are auto-generated during build by `npm run merge-locales` and will be overwritten. Always edit the source files in individual locale directories (e.g., `src/locales/en/auth.json`).

Architecture of the shared Vue + ASP.NET Core JSON catalog is explained in [`docs/SHARED_I18N.md`](docs/SHARED_I18N.md).

## Local development assumptions

- backend default dev URL: `http://localhost:5016`
- frontend default dev URL: `https://localhost:8095` (Vite HTTPS via mkcert-trusted certs; `/api` and `/hubs` proxied to the backend)
- backend development config seeds the database on startup
- Swagger is the source of truth for current routes and schemas
- **Contributor workflow:** the repo owner usually keeps their own backend dev instance running (`dotnet watch` / `dotnet run` / IDE) and the Vite dev server (`npm run dev`) for hot reload. **Do not rebuild backend or frontend for routine code changes** — `dotnet watch` hot-reloads many C# edits (it also fails on a lot of them) and Vite hot-reloads Vue/TS. Avoid `dotnet build`, `dotnet run`, `npm run build`, and `npm run dev` unless the task explicitly requires it, the OpenAPI regen steps above apply, or the contributor asks you to verify a build. If you must rebuild for something other than `--exit-after-start`, ask them to stop their running backend first (file-lock on `Backend.exe` causes MSB3026 copy failures). Prefer `dotnet test --no-build` when a recent build already exists.
- **OpenAPI regen:** when backend DTOs, controllers, or routes changed, run `dotnet run -- --exit-after-start` from `backend/` and then `npm run gen` from `frontend/`. Do this even if `dotnet watch` is already running: that command does not listen, and watch never rewrites `tallyj.json` (the spec is written only on a fresh start). Frontend-only edits do not need OpenAPI regeneration.

### Configuration sources (Program.cs)

The backend merges settings from many locations (later sources override earlier ones). In rough order:

- `appsettings.json` + `appsettings.{Environment}.json` (Development / Production / Testing)
- `appsettings.{MachineName}.json` (optional, reload-on-change)
- `appsettings.{SiteType}.json` (Development / Production / UAT / etc.)
- `version.json` (required, loaded from repo root)
- `TALLYJ_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable (points at a single JSON file — very useful for Docker / shared hosting)
- Hard-coded fallback locations: `c:\AppSettings\TallyJ4.json` and `TallyJ4.{SiteType}.json` (intentionally outside the repo tree)
- User secrets and environment variables (the recommended place for all secrets: `ConnectionStrings:TallyJ4`, `Jwt:Key`, `Google:*`, `Twilio:*`, `SuperAdmin:Emails`, etc.)
- `launchSettings.json` only affects `dotnet run` / `dotnet watch` profiles.

`backend/Program.cs` `ConfigureServices` (config file loading + the startup logging that reports exactly which files were loaded) is the authoritative implementation. For local development work, prefer user secrets or a machine-specific file so you never accidentally commit secrets.

## Shell environment — detect before running commands

This repo is developed on both **Windows** and **Linux** (Azure DevOps CI runs on Windows,
GitHub Copilot / CI agents may run on Linux). Before issuing shell commands, check the
tool environment (e.g. the `env` block that identifies `OS Name`, or `uname` / `ver`
output) and pick the matching syntax. The sections below are split accordingly.

General rules that apply everywhere:

- Prefer the `Grep` (ripgrep) and `Read` tools over shell `findstr` / `grep` / `cat` — they work
  identically on both platforms and have no quoting pitfalls.
- Use forward slashes in code and config (`./path/to/file`); only switch to backslashes when
  invoking a native Windows command that requires them.
- Any code, tests, or scripts you write must run on **both** Windows and Linux unless the
  feature is explicitly platform-gated.

## Windows CMD file operations

_Applies only when the tool harness reports Windows / `cmd.exe`. On Linux use standard
POSIX equivalents (`rm -f`, `test -e`, etc.)._

When deleting repo files from the Windows CMD-based shell tooling in this workspace:

- run from the workspace root and use repo-relative paths
- for a single file, prefer `if exist "docs\OLD.md" del /q "docs\OLD.md"`
- for multiple files, prefer a guarded loop instead of one long `del` command:

```bat
for %f in ("API_DOCUMENTATION.md" "docs\ADMIN_GUIDE.md" "backend\API_EXAMPLES.md") do @if exist %f del /q %f
```

- verify deletions from the same worktree context with `if exist ...` and `git status --short`
- if `git status` does not show a tracked file as deleted, the removal did not affect the active worktree

## Windows CMD search and output parsing

_Applies only when the tool harness reports Windows / `cmd.exe`. On Linux, use `grep`
(or better, the `Grep` tool) with standard POSIX quoting — none of the pitfalls below apply._

When searching command output or files from CMD-based tooling, prefer the Grep tool over `findstr`. If you must use `findstr`:

- `findstr` does not accept multiple space-separated terms inside a single quoted string the way ripgrep does. Use `/c:"phrase"` for literal phrases, or repeat `/c:` for OR-style matching:

```bat
findstr /i /c:"canvote" /c:"canreceive" /c:"failed" file.txt
```

- Never chain searches with `&` and reuse quoted patterns containing spaces — CMD will treat trailing tokens as filenames and you get `FINDSTR: Cannot open ...` errors.
- Do not pipe `type file` into `more +0` as a way to "show all" — `more` paginates and truncates in this tool harness. Read the file directly with the `Read` tool when you want the full contents.
- For multi-term searches across the repo, the `Grep` tool (ripgrep) is faster and quoting is sane.

## Windows CMD directory changes

_Applies only when the tool harness reports Windows / `cmd.exe`. On Linux use `cd <path> && ...`
with normal POSIX quoting._

- `cd /d <path>` with an **unquoted** path works reliably in this tool harness:
  `cd /d c:\Dev\TallyJ\v4\repo && dotnet build ...`
- `cd /d "<path>"` with the path wrapped in **double quotes** has been observed to fail with
  `The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect.` even for valid paths.
  Quote the path only if it actually contains spaces; otherwise leave it unquoted.
- CMD chaining uses `&&` (on success) or `&` (always). Semicolons (`;`) are **ignored** —
  do not port bash one-liners verbatim.

## Running dotnet commands

These apply on both Windows and Linux:

- **Default:** do not run `dotnet build` or restart the backend — the contributor's `dotnet watch` hot-reloads many C# edits, though it fails on a lot of them. It never rewrites the OpenAPI spec; use `--exit-after-start` for that (see above).
- If a backend rebuild is needed, confirm the contributor has stopped their locally running backend first (see **Local development assumptions**). A running `Backend.exe` locks the output and causes MSB3026 copy failures.
- For targeted test runs, `dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~ClassName.MethodPrefix"` works
  well. Multiple filters can be OR-combined with `|`:
  `--filter "FullyQualifiedName~A|FullyQualifiedName~B"`.
- Prefer `--no-build` on repeat test runs after a successful build to save ~10s per invocation.
- Backend must build and test cleanly on both OSes. SQL Server LocalDB is **not** available on
  Linux; integration tests use SQLite via `CustomWebApplicationFactory`. Any EF Core model tweaks
  should keep both providers working (e.g. the `DateTimeOffset` value converter applied when the
  provider is not SQL Server in `MainDbContext.OnModelCreating`).

Windows-only caveat:

- Do NOT pipe `dotnet build` / `dotnet test` output through `findstr` when the command itself
  contains double-quoted arguments (e.g. `--filter "FullyQualifiedName~..."`). CMD collapses the
  nested quotes and `findstr` ends up with mangled patterns like `FINDSTR: Cannot open test"`.
  Run the `dotnet` command without the pipe — the Bash tool captures full output — or save to a
  file first and use the `Grep` tool on that file. On Linux, piping through `grep` is safe.

## Frontend workflow note

The contributor typically already has `npm run dev` running with Vite HMR. **Do not start or rebuild the frontend** (`npm run dev`, `npm run build`) for routine Vue/TS edits — save the file and let hot reload apply changes. Only use `npm run build` when you explicitly need a production build or are validating production output.

## Reviewing and actioning external PR feedback (Copilot, human reviewers)

When a task is "review the Copilot suggestions on PR N and fix them here" (or equivalent for human review comments):

**Preferred extraction flow (use this pattern):**

1. Use the available `gh` CLI (it is usually logged in). Avoid web scraping PR pages.
2. Get structured metadata: `gh pr view N -R owner/repo --json files,baseRefName,headRefName`
3. Extract **only** the actionable comments with projection (critical for low context noise):
   ```bash
   gh api repos/owner/repo/pulls/N/comments \
     --jq 'map(select(.user.login | contains("copilot"))) | map({path, line, body, diff_hunk: (.diff_hunk | gsub("\n"; " | "))})' \
     > copilot-comments.json
   ```
4. Also save a clean diff for reference: `gh pr diff N -R owner/repo > pr.diff`
5. Use `read_file` on the small clean `.json`, not the raw full API response.
6. Read **only the files mentioned** in the comments (use `offset`/`limit` for large Vue or .ts files).

**During the work:**

- Track the set of comments + files with `todo_write`.
- For any frontend user-facing string changes, **strictly** obey the "Locales" section above (only edit `src/locales/en/`, run `npm run validate:i18n`).
- Correlate comments to code using the saved `diff_hunk` + the actual source (or the saved `pr.diff`).
- After edits, run the documented validation commands for the area changed (`npm run check` in frontend, relevant tests in backend).

**Environment notes:**

- This harness has shell quirks with complex pipes (`head`, `tail`, `Select-String`, `Out-String`). Prefer writing output to a file then using the `Read` or `Grep` tools on it.
- Consider invoking the available `code-review` or `review` skills (see system skills) to analyze the suggestions before you start editing — especially when there are >5 comments or the intent is ambiguous.

**Goal:** Minimal context bloat, fast comment → root cause → minimal correct fix, while respecting all project conventions.

## Documentation hygiene

When features change, update the canonical docs above instead of adding one-off summary files.

Avoid leaving behind implementation summaries, phase reports, or temporary investigation notes as long-term guidance unless the repository explicitly wants them preserved as archives.
